# glossRy

A small glossary of terms used in R and data science, designed for novices who
are still orienting themselves.  Contributions are very welcome: please see [the
contribution guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) if you would like to lend and hand,
and please note that all contributors must abide by our [Code of
Conduct](CONDUCT.md).

## Definitions

**absolute path**: A path that points to the same location in the filesystem
  regardless of where it's evaluated. An absolute path is the equivalent of
  latitude and longitude in geography. See also *relative path*.

**aggregation function**: A function that combines many values into one, such as
  `sum` or `max`.

**base R**: FIXME

**binary**: FIXME

**branch**: A snapshot of a version of a git repository. Multiple branches can capture multiple versions of the same repository. A *feature* branch captures the version of a repository that is under development and/or implements a new feature or correction. A *master* branch is the snapshot of the main version of a repository. See also **fork**.

**Cascading Style Sheets**: A way to describe how HTML should be rendered.

**character encoding**: A specification of how characters are stored as
  bytes. The most commonly-used encoding today is *UTF-8*.

**closure**: A set of variables defined in the same *scope* whose existence has
  been preserved after that scope has ended. Closures are one of the trickiest
  ideas in programming.

**Comma-Separated Values**: A text format for tabular data in which each record
  is one row and fields are separated by commas. There are many minor
  variations, particularly around quoting of strings.

**data frame**: FIXME

**escape sequence**: A sequence of characters used to represent some other
  character that would otherwise have a special meaning. For example, the escape
  sequence `\"` is used to represent a double-quote character inside a
  double-quoted string.

**exception**: An object that stores information about an error or other unusual
  event in a program. One part of a program will create and *throw* an exception
  to signal that something unexpected has happened; another part will *catch*
  it.

**falsy**: A horrible neologism meaning "equivalent to false". See also the
  equally horrible *truthy*.
  
**fork**: A copy of a developer's git repository that lives on a user's git repository. Changes to the content of a repository should always be implemented on a fork and then merged into the developers repository via a **pull request**. See also **branch**.

**functional programming**: A style of programming in which data is transformed
  through successive application of functions, rather than by using control
  structures such as loops. Functional programming in R relies heavily on
  *higher-order functions*.

**git** A version control tool to manage changes of a project on your local machine. *GitHub* is a cloud-based provider of a tool build around *git* that allows you to save versions of your project online. 

**global installation**: Installing a package in a location where it can be
  accessed by all users and projects. See also *local installation*.

**global variable**: A variable defined outside any particular function, which
  is therefore visible to all functions. See also *local variable*.

**GNU Public License**: A license that allows people to re-use software as long
  as they distribute the source of their changes.

**header row**: If present, the first of a *CSV* file that defines column names
  (but tragically, not their data types or units).

**heterogeneous**: Having mixed type. For example, an *array* is said to be
  heterogeneous if it contains a mix of numbers, character strings, and values
  of other types. See also *homogeneous*.

**higher-order function**: A function that operates on other functions. For
  example, the higher-order function `map` executes a given function once on
  each value in an *list*. Higher-order functions are heavily used in
  *functional programming*.

**homogeneous**: Having a single type. For example, an *array* is said to be
  homogeneous if it contains only numbers or only character strings, but not a
  mix of the two.

**Integrated Development Environment (IDE)**: FIXME

**JSON**: A way to represent data by combining basic values like numbers and
  character strings in *arrays* and name/value structures. The acronym stands
  for "JavaScript Object Notation"; unlike better-defined standards like *XML*,
  it is unencumbered by a syntax for comments or ways to define *schemas*.

**lazy evaluation**: see *non-standard evaluation*.

**list**: FIXME.

**local installation**: Placing a package inside a particular project so that it
  is only accessible within that project. See also *global installation*.

**local variable**: A variable defined inside a function which is only visible
  within that function. See also *global variable* and *closure*.

**MIT License**: A license that allows people to re-use software with no
**restrictions.  mutation**: Changing data in place, such as modifying an
**element of an array or adding a record to a database.

**name collision**: The ambiguity that arises when two or more things in a
  program that have the same name are active at the same time. The *call stack*
  was invented in part to address this problem.

**non-standard evaluation**: FIXME.

**NoSQL database**: Any database that doesn't use the *relational* model.  The
  awkward name comes from the fact that such databases don't use *SQL* as a
  query language.

**package**: FIXME

**package manager**: A program that does its best to keep track of the bits and
  bobs of software installed on a computer.

**parameter**: A variable whose value is passed into a function when the
  function is called. Some writers distinguish parameters (the variables) from
  *arguments* (the values passed in), but others use the terms in the opposite
  sense. It's all very confusing.

**parse**: To translate the text of a program or web page into a data structure
  in memory that the program can then manipulate.

**production code**: Software that is delivered to an end user. The term is used
  to distinguish such code from test code, deployment infrastructure, and
  everything else that programmers write along the way.

**pseudo-random number**: A value generated in a repeatable way that has the
  properties of being truly random.

**pseudo-random number generator**: A function that can generate a series of
  *pseudo-random numbers* after being initialized with a *seed*.
  
**pull request**: The request to merge a new feature or correction created on a user's fork of a git repository into the developer's main branch of the git repository. The developer will be notified of the change, review it, make or suggest changes, and potentially merge it. See also **fork**.

**R Markdown**: FIXME

**raise**: To signal that something unexpected or unusual has happened in a
  program by creating an *exception* and handing it to the error-handling
  system, which then tries to find a point in the program that will *catch* it.

**read-evaluate-print loop**: An interactive program that reads a command typed
  in by a user, executes it, prints the result, and then waits patiently for the
  next command. REPLs are often used to explore new ideas or for debugging.

**regular expression**: A pattern for matching text, written as text
  itself. Regular expressions are sometimes called "regexp", "regex", or "RE",
  and are as powerful as they are cryptic.  See [this
  documentation][regular-expression-doc] for more details.

**relational database**: A database that organizes information into *tables*,
  each of which has a fixed set of named *fields* (shown as columns) and a
  variable number of *records* (shown as rows). See also *SQL*.

**relative path**: A path whose destination is interpreted relative to some
  other location, such as the current directory. A relative path is the
  equivalent of giving directions using terms like "straight" and "left". See
  also *absolute path*.
  
**reprex**: A reproducible example. When asking questions about coding problems online or filing issues on GitHub, you should always include a *reprex* so others can reproduce your problem and help. The [reprex](https://github.com/tidyverse/reprex) package can help!

**root directory**: The directory that contains everything else, directly or
  indirectly. The root directory is written `/` (a bare forward slash).

**scalar**: FIXME

**scope**: The portion of a program within which a definition can be seen and
  used. See *global-variable*, *local-variable*, and *closure*.

**script**: FIXME

**seed**: A value used to initialize a *pseudo-random number generator*.

**SQL**: The language used for writing queries for *relational databases*. The
  term was originally an acronym for Structured Query Language.

**string**: A block of text in a program. The term is short for "character
  string".

**string interpolation**: The process of inserting text corresponding to
  specified values into a string, usually to make output human-readable.

**table**: A set of uniformly-formatted *records* in a *relational database*.
  Tables are usually drawn with rows (each of which represents one record) and
  columns (each of which represents a *field*).

**tibble**: FIXME

**tidy data**: FIXME

**tidyverse**: FIXME

**truthy**: A truly Orwellian neologism meaning "not equivalent to false". See
  also *falsy*, but only if you are able to set aside your respect for the
  English language.

**Unicode**: A standard that defines numeric codes for many thousands of
  characters and symbols. Unicode does not define how those numbers are stored;
  that is done by standards like *UTF-8*.

**unit test**: A test that exercises one property or expected behavior of a
  system.

**UTF-8**: A way to store the numeric codes representing Unicode characters in
  memory that is *backward-compatible* with the older *ASCII* standard.

**variable**: A name in a program that has some data associated with it. A
  variable's value can be changed after definition. See also *constant*.

**vector**: FIXME

**whitespace**: The space, newline, carriage return, and horizontal and vertical
  tab characters that take up space but don't create a visible mark.  The name
  comes from their appearance on a printed page in the era of typewriters.
